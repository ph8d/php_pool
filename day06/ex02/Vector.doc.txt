<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class offers a coordinate encapsulation, reading and writing assessors
and provides a few methods that will do simple calculations.

The Class constructor is waiting for an array. The following keys are required:
- "dest": the vector’s destination vertex - mandatory.
 -"orig": the vector’s origin vertex, optional, by default is worth a new instance of
the x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, w = 1 vertex.

Available methods:

float magnitude();
Returns the vector’s length (or "norm").

Vector normalize();
Returns a normalized version of the vector.
If the vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs );
Returns the sum vector of both vectors.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite();
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct( $k );
Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.

float cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vectors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cross multiplication of both vectors.
